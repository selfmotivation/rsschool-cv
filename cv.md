3. I really want to became front-end developer, but looking for HTML-coder (may I say like that? "Верстальщик" I mean) _career_ at first. Of course common benefits are:
  * Remote job
  * Possibility to earn some more with freelance
  * Flexibility of required knowledge for that job (I don't want to stand still)
4. HTML, HTML5, CSS, CSS3, GIT. Everything's low level.
5. Just one useless auth form... More trying to learn usually than practice.
6. Nothing to show here for now.
7. HTML Academy (free courses), Codecademy (free courses), youtube videos, articles throughout the Internet, htmlbook.ru, webref.ru, BeonMax ([HTML/CSS](https://beonmax.com/certificates/5ed5343c88f33f6af4ce4fa9e071e885/ru/), [Bootstrap3](https://beonmax.com/certificates/da93a1d6b0d5758f9ede00ad1db8d6d7/ru/)).
8. According to [Englex.ru](https://englex.ru/your-level/placement/?answer_id=2614678&hidesend=1) - Intermediate. But I don't feel like I know English for that level.
